<p>
    We care about your privacy. When Firefox online services sends information to Mozilla (that&#39;s us), the Mozilla Privacy Policy below describes how we handle
    that information.
</p>
<p>
    Things you should know:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Firefox online services uses cookies and other web technologies to provide its functionality (such as remembering you between sessions) and to help us
            understand how users use the service through aggregate analytics.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Firefox accounts sends Mozilla your email address and password. Firefox Sync sends Mozilla your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and certain
            browser preferences. We do not share this data with others and we use it solely to provide you with Firefox online services. If you request to have your
            Firefox account deleted, we will no longer retain this information.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Mozilla Privacy Policy
</h4>
<p>
    Your privacy is an important factor that Mozilla (that's us) considers in the development of each of our products and services. We are committed to being
    transparent and open and want you to know how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
</p>
<h4>
    What do we mean by "personal information?"
</h4>
<p>
    For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.
</p>
<p>
    Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."
</p>
<p>
    If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all
    personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.
</p>

<h4>
    How do we learn information about you?
</h4>
<p>
    We learn information about you when:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports from Firefox);
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when we check whether your version of Firefox is up to date);
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            someone else tells us information about you (e.g., Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account); or
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our
            services).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    What do we do with your information once we have it?
</h4>
<p>
    When you give us personal information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us
    provide and improve our products and services for you.
</p>

<h4>
    When do we share your information with others?
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            When we have gotten your permission to share it.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the
            data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When we are fulfilling our mission of being open. We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do so,
            we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're
            asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only
            release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal
            defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that
            it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor
            or affiliate.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    How do we store and protect your personal information?
</h4>
<p>
    We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our
    efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
</p>
<p>
    We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't
    need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.
</p>
<h4>
    What else do we want you know?
</h4>
<p>
    We're a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be
    in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different
    level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country
    your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is
    under 13 has provided us with personal information, please <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/policies/firefox-os/">contact us</a> to have your child's information removed.
</p>
<h4>
    What if we change this policy?
</h4>
<p>
    We may need to change this policy and when we do, we'll notify you.
